# CustomBarChart
 
This is a fully natively constructed BarChart developed in SwiftUI, specifically built for projects that are Swift 15.x and above ( where SwiftCharts framework cannot be consumed die to version limitations )

The classes are fully customizable, so it can be deployed as it is or can be refactored as per the business requirements
